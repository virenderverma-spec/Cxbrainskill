## Meow Mobile

### Product Offering

#### Meow Mobile Plan - 3 months for $15/month
*Article ID: 46627089482779 | Updated: 2026-02-13*
*URL: https://rockstarautomations.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/46627089482779-Meow-Mobile-Plan-3-months-for-15-month*

The pricing structure has changed from the previous $50/month + taxes model. The new structure reduces the effective monthly base rate after the initial 3-month period.

All plan benefits remain unchanged:

- Unlimited talk
- Unlimited text
- Unlimited data
- 24/7 vet care access
## **How the Offer Works**### **1. Initial Purchase – Covers First 3 Months**At checkout, customers make one upfront payment that covers the first 3 full months of service (Months 1–3).

This is not a monthly charge. It is a single charge covering the entire 3-month period.

### **Cost Breakdown for Months 1–3**
- Base Plan: $45.00 (covers all 3 months)
- Vet Service Fee: Waived for the first 3 months
- Recovery Fee: $6.00 ($2 × 3 months)
- Taxes: Vary depending on jurisdiction
**Total at Checkout:**
$51.00 + applicable taxes

This equals $15/month (before taxes) for the first 3 months.

There are no additional charges during Months 1–3, as they are fully covered by the upfront payment.

### **System Indicator**In the billing payload, the system reflects:

- recurringChargePeriodLength: 3This confirms that the initial charge covers a 3-month billing period.

The upfront charge includes:

- Data
- Voice
- SMS
- Included/zero-rated fees for the full 3-month period
## **Automatic Transition After 3 Months**Starting in Month 4, billing automatically transitions to a standard monthly cycle.

### **Month 4 and Beyond – Monthly Charges**
- Base Plan: $30.00
- Vet Service Fee: $2.00
- Recovery Fee: $2.00
- Taxes: Vary by jurisdiction
**Total Monthly Charge from Month 4:**
$34.00 + applicable taxes

This replaces the previous $50/month + taxes pricing model.

Standard recurring billing applies from this point forward.

## **Customer Billing Timeline**### **Month 0 – Purchase Date**
- Customer pays one upfront charge covering 3 full months.
- The plan activates immediately.
- The “Next Billing Date” should display purchase date + 3 months.
### **Months 1–3**
- No additional charges are applied.
- Service remains active.
- These months are fully covered by the initial upfront payment.
- Notifications should reflect that billing resumes after the 3-month period.
### **Month 4 and Onward**
- Monthly billing resumes.
- Customer is charged:
$30 base plan
- $2 Vet Service Fee
- $2 Recovery Feeapplicable taxes

- Standard monthly billing cycle continues.
## **Known Issue – Next Billing Date Display**There is a known display/notification issue affecting some accounts.

In certain cases, the “Next Billing Date” may incorrectly show the following month after purchase.

Important clarification:

- This is only a visual or notification bug.
- The system billing logic is correct.
- Customers are not charged early.
- The actual charge occurs after the full 3-month period.
If customers raise concerns about the displayed date, reassure them that their billing is accurate and aligned with the 3-month prepaid structure.

## **Summary for Support Reference**
- First 3 months are paid upfront in a single charge.
- Total upfront: $51.00 + taxes.
- No charges during Months 1–3.
- Month 4 billing resumes at $34.00 + taxes per month.
- Benefits remain unchanged.
- Any early “Next Billing Date” shown is a display issue only.

#### Super Secret Club
*Article ID: 44556507620507 | Updated: 2025-12-18*
*URL: https://rockstarautomations.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/44556507620507-Super-Secret-Club*

# **[Hairy Meow.png]Meow Mobile Super Secret Club**## **Overview**The **Meow Mobile Super Secret Club** is a private group of approximately 100 early supporters who have been granted **lifetime free Meow Mobile mobile service**.

This program exists to:

- Reward early trust in Meow Mobile
- Gather high-quality, real-world feedback
- Build a direct, human relationship between our team and our earliest users
Members of the Super Secret Club are part of a special early cohort and are not enrolled through any public promotion.

## **What members receive**Members of the Meow Mobile Super Secret Club receive:

- **Lifetime free Meow Mobile mobile service**
- **$0 cost — including all taxes, fees, and surcharges**
- Access to the Meow Mobile plan **as it exists today**

- Certain additional benefits and features that are **currently included at no cost**

- A direct feedback channel with the Meow Mobile team
- Early visibility into updates and changes when applicable
As long as the member’s line remains active and in good standing, **they will never be billed** for the included mobile service.

## **What “lifetime free” means (important)**
- “Lifetime” means for as long as the **original recipient** keeps their Meow Mobile service continuously active
- The benefit is **personal, one-time, and non-transferable**

- If a member cancels, ports out, suspends service (outside of Meow Mobile-approved temporary suspensions), or otherwise leaves Meow Mobile, the lifetime benefit ends permanently and cannot be reinstated
- The offer has no cash value and cannot be exchanged, refunded, or resold
## **What is included at no cost**The lifetime free benefit covers:

- The **Meow Mobile mobile service subscription as it exists today**

- All required **taxes, fees, and surcharges**, fully covered by Meow Mobile
Members will pay **absolutely nothing** for the included mobile service.

## **Ancillary and third-party services (important)**Some features included with Meow Mobile today (for example, veterinary telehealth) are provided by third-party partners.

- These services are **currently included at no cost** for members of the Meow Mobile Super Secret Club
- Unlike the mobile service itself, **we do not guarantee these services will remain the same or be included forever**

- Partners, features, or benefits may change over time as we improve the experience or operate the business responsibly
- We may replace existing services or introduce new benefits that enhance or augment the overall experience
- Any changes to ancillary or third-party services **do not affect the lifetime free mobile service subscription**

The lifetime guarantee applies **only** to the Meow Mobile mobile service.

## **What is *****not***** included (now and in the future)**The lifetime free benefit does **not** include:

- International usage or roaming
- Premium features, add-ons, or optional third-party services
- Future products that increase or extend high-speed data usage
In the future, Meow Mobile may offer optional products that allow users to:

- Increase high-speed data after exceeding current thresholds
More than **50GB of personal data**, or
- More than **10GB of hotspot usage**

If introduced, these products **will not be included** as part of the lifetime free benefit.

## **Important clarification (current state)**At this time:

- Meow Mobile does **not** support international usage or roaming
- No paid add-ons or data extension products are available
As a result, **there is currently no way for Super Secret Club members to incur additional charges**.

Any future optional products would:

- Be clearly communicated
- Require explicit user opt-in
- Never affect the lifetime free mobile service itself
## **Community space**Members of the Meow Mobile Super Secret Club are invited to a **private Facebook Group** created exclusively for this cohort.

The group is used for:

- Sharing feedback and experiences
- Flagging issues or questions
- Receiving updates from the Meow Mobile team
- Light community interaction with other early members
This space is for feedback and collaboration and is **not a formal customer support channel**, though the team actively monitors and responds.

## **How the Meow Mobile team uses the group**
- The team regularly reviews posts and comments
- Feedback is shared internally with product, operations, and network teams
- Responses are written by real team members, not automated systems
- Internal coordination may happen in Slack, but replies are always made directly to members in the Facebook Group
## **Expectations for members**Members are expected to:

- Provide honest and respectful feedback
- Understand that Meow Mobile is early and evolving
- Avoid sharing sensitive personal information publicly
- Use the community constructively
Fraud, abuse, or misuse of service may result in removal from the Super Secret Club and forfeiture of the lifetime benefit.

## **Expectations to set clearly (for team & AI)**
- There are **no guaranteed response times**

- Feedback does **not guarantee product changes**

- The Super Secret Club does **not override** Meow Mobile’s Terms & Conditions
- Network coverage, speeds, and performance may vary by location and device
## **Common questions & answers****Q: Will I ever be charged anything?**
A: No. Your Meow Mobile mobile service, including all taxes and fees, is fully covered as long as your service remains active and eligible.

**Q: Is veterinary telehealth included for life?**
A: Veterinary telehealth is currently included at no cost, but it is not guaranteed to remain the same or included forever. The lifetime guarantee applies only to the mobile service.

**Q: Are international or roaming charges included?**
A: No. International and roaming are not currently supported. If launched in the future, they will not be included.

**Q: Are future high-speed data add-ons included?**
A: No. If optional data extension products are introduced later, they will not be included.

**Q: Can I leave and rejoin later?**
A: No. If you leave Meow Mobile, the lifetime benefit ends permanently.

## **AI-safe short summary**The Meow Mobile Super Secret Club is a private group of early members who receive lifetime free Meow Mobile mobile service with all taxes and fees covered. Some additional features are currently included at no cost but may change over time. The lifetime guarantee applies only to the mobile service itself.

#### Offers & Services
*Article ID: 42175975142427 | Updated: 2025-12-17*
*URL: https://rockstarautomations.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/42175975142427-Offers-Services*

Meow Mobile is a prepaid, eSIM-only mobile service designed for pet parents! For $50/month, you get unlimited talk, text, and data, plus 24/7 access to licensed vets through the Airvet app. It's simple, contract-free, and works on most unlocked, eSIM-compatible phones. 

The fair use limit is 50GB of high-speed data per billing cycle. After you hit 50GB, your data stays unlimited but slows to 128 kbps. That slower speed lasts until your next plan renewal date. 

Unlike regular mobile providers, Meow Mobile is built for cat parents. Unlimited talk, text, and data plus round‑the‑clock vet care through Airvet. The perfect blend of staying connected and caring for your kitty — all in one plan.

*URL: https://rockstarautomations.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/42174785773339-Workflow*

**User Type**
**Workflow**

New User
Create Account → Purchase Subscription → Transfer Number (Optional) → Activate eSIM → Activate 24x7 vet care → Home

FDT User*
Purchase Subscription → Transfer Number (Optional) → Activate eSIM → Activate 24x7 vet care → Home

*FDT User already has an account created
 

 

[Entire Customer Journey ](https://excalidraw.com/?name=Customer%20Journey#room=2cef0e28773f6579082f,XqwB2HGmJ5YfGxoMYBuPYw) ( Please do not make any changes in the specified link)

 

- **Create Account**
User can create an account or sign-in using Apple or Google sign-in only. No manual email based login is supported.

[InitialSignupimage.jpg]

 

- **Purchase Subscription**
Post account creation (new user) or sign-in (FDT user, when enabled for purchase post launch), will see the following screens to make a purchase

- We’ll only have one plan auto applied for the user, i.e. the user doesn’t need to select the planPlan: Unlimited data, talk & text with 24x7 Vetcare at $X per month

- Zipcode is needed for internal purposes (e.g. tax calculation), hence we request user to enter it while also checking their network coverage at the provided location
- User can pay via 3 payment methods
iOS → Apple Pay (default), Card and PayPal
- Android → Google Pay (default), Card and PayPal

- Post purchase, user has to complete 3 steps before being taken to the home screen → (1) Transfer Number (Port-in) → Optional step; (2) Install & activate eSIM; (3) Activate non-telco benefit (24x7 Vetcare)

 

Note:

- There is no KYC to onboard user.
- User is by default onboarded on a new number. User has an option to transfer their number at the next step.
- User doesn’t have an option to select their new number (AT&T limitation).
- Payment is collected (i.e. customer’s account is debited) instantly when order is placed.
- User is by default enabled for auto-pay (30-day subscription renewal cycle).

[AccountSetup.jpg]

 

- **Transfer Number (Port-in)**
User is by default onboarded on a new number, and has an option to transfer their existing number at this step. User can also skip this step if needed.
 

Note:

- User needs a PIN from their existing carrier to initiate a transfer number (port-in) process.
- Transfer Number (Port-in) is near realtime, and could take up to few mins to complete → According to our partner, it can take between 2-5 mins for most customers.

[PortingOverview.jpg]

 

- **Activate eSIM**
User will be able to install & activate eSIM with one click from the app.

[esimActivation.jpg]

 

- **Activate 24x7 Vetcare**
This is still WIP → [delbert.ty@rockstar-automations.com](mailto:delbert.ty@rockstar-automations.com) can provide context once the journey & integration approach is finalized

[Customer Journey](https://excalidraw.com/?name=Customer%20Journey#room=2cef0e28773f6579082f,XqwB2HGmJ5YfGxoMYBuPYw) (Please don't make any changes in the specified link) 

 

- **Home → Cat Wellness**Since our core value proposition is anchored on non-telco benefit (cat wellness), the user has an option to search for anything related to cat wellness and more → The search will fetch & synthesize relevant content from Reddit & display to the user. The user will have an option to “Save” or “Share” the result or talk to a vetcare if they have more queries. The user will also have a separate option to directly talk to the vet via video call or chat whenever needed

 

Note:

- This search will be the entry point for customer service chatbot as well → Based on user query, we would redirect the user to search result or customer service chatbot.

 

- **Profile**Since the telco plan is Unlimited (data, talk & text), the core focus of customer journey is on non-telco benefit and experience. 

 

Note:

- [Deprioritised and will be available post launch] → The user will be shown the “X” GB left banner (when data remaining is less than 5GB) and allowed to purchase additional high speed data.
- Manage Telco Plan → User can manage key telco related actions in self-serve mode, rest will be managed via chatbot.
Manage Payments → Change payment method.
- Payment History → All purchases are shown here. Since we’re offering prepaid service, no bill is provided. Instead an invoice will be available to download for each payment made on our platform.
- Update Address → In case the user decides to update their address later.
- Transfer Number (Port-out) → User can view the PIN needed to transfer their number out from Meow Mobile to any other carrier.
- Terminate Account → User can request to terminate their account.

### Customer Profile

#### How to Check Customer's Account if They Cannot Access it?
*Article ID: 42223257266203 | Updated: 2025-12-17*
*URL: https://rockstarautomations.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/42223257266203-How-to-Check-Customer-s-Account-if-They-Cannot-Access-it*

Updated:

### Situation:Customers usually ask this question when:

- They’re unable to log in to their Meow Wireless account or app.

- Their registered email or Apple Private Relay email isn’t working.

- They’re not receiving the password reset link or access email.

- Their phone is lost, damaged, or they switched to a new device.

- They need help verifying their identity to recover access.

This may also occur after reinstalling the app, switching devices, or changing login credentials linked to Apple ID or another service.

### Task:The agent’s goal is to:

- Confirm the customer’s identity securely.

- Identify whether the login issue is related to credentials, device, or Apple Private Relay.

- Guide the customer through the correct recovery process.

- Escalate cases requiring identity verification or manual login reset.

### Steps for Agents:#### Check the account in ConnectX:
- Go to ConnectX → Customer360.

- Search using the customer’s email address or phone number.

- 
Verify:

Account status (Active / Locked / Suspended)

- Last login attempt

- Linked email type (Private Relay or regular email)

- Any recent password reset or access recovery activity

#### Ask clarifying and verification questions:
- “Can you confirm the email you used to sign up with Meow Wireless?”

- “Are you using an Apple Private Relay email (it usually looks like @privaterelay.appleid.com)?”

- “Did you try accessing your account through the Meow Wireless app or the website?”

- “Is your phone currently available, or do you need access from another device?”

These questions help identify whether the customer can log in through the app or needs identity verification via email.

### Action:#### If customer can still access their email (non-Private Relay):Example Response:

#### How to Update Customer Information in ConnectX?
*Article ID: 42223005974171 | Updated: 2025-11-10*
*URL: https://rockstarautomations.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/42223005974171-How-to-Update-Customer-Information-in-ConnectX*

Updated:

### Situation:Customers usually ask this question when:

- They notice incorrect details on their Meow Wireless account (e.g., name, email, phone number, or cat information).

- They recently changed their contact details and want to update them.

- Their account profile shows outdated information in the Meow Wireless app or portal.

- They are unable to edit some fields directly in the app and need agent assistance.

This may also come up when the customer is trying to ensure their shipping, billing, or pet information is accurate before activation or billing.

### Task:The agent’s goal is to:

- Verify the customer’s identity and confirm account ownership.

- Review and confirm which information needs updating.

- Update editable details in ConnectX or guide the customer on how to update it in-app.

- Escalate if the requested field cannot be edited manually (e.g., verified email, linked number).

### Steps for Agents:#### Access the customer record in ConnectX:
- Go to ConnectX → Customer360.

- Search for the customer using their email address or phone number.

- Open their Profile tab to view current personal and pet details.

#### Verify ownership and identity:Before making any updates, confirm the customer’s identity by asking for:

- Registered email or phone number,

- Order ID or waitlist reference number (if applicable),

- Or confirm details such as last transaction or recent activity.

#### Review editable sections:Within the Customer360 view, check:

- Contact Information → Name, Email, Phone number

- Address or billing information → Home/shipping address (if applicable)

Editable fields will display an “Edit” or “Update” icon.

#### Ask clarifying questions to ensure accuracy:To confirm what needs to be updated and where:

- “Which details would you like to update — your name, contact number, or cat information?”

- “Can you confirm the correct spelling or updated details you’d like us to use?”

- “Did you already try updating your information through the app or portal?”

- “Are you updating this for your main profile or your cat’s information?”

These questions help confirm whether the issue is an app limitation or a data mismatch.

#### Update or guide accordingly:
- If editable in ConnectX: Update the field and click Save Changes.

- If not editable: Advise the customer to update directly in the Meow Wireless app.

### Action:#### If agent can update directly:Example Response:
“I’ve updated your contact information in our system as requested. Please allow a few minutes for the changes to reflect in your Meow Wireless app. If you don’t see the update after refreshing, you can try logging out and back in.”

Next Steps for Agent:

- Confirm the updated field and timestamp in ConnectX.

- Tag the ticket appropriately.

- Note changes in the ticket for reference.

#### If customer needs to update via the app:Example Response:
“You can update your personal details directly through your Meow Wireless app by going to Profile → Account Information → Edit. Once saved, the changes sync automatically with your Meow Wireless account.”

Next Steps for Agent:

- Guide customer through steps visually if needed.

- Tag the ticket accordingly.

- Set to “Solved” after confirmation from the customer.

#### If field is locked or requires backend update:Example Response:
“Some details, like verified email or linked phone number, can only be updated internally for security reasons. I’ll escalate your request to our Account Management Team for verification and update. This process usually takes **2–3 business days**.”

Next Steps for Agent:

- Escalate to Viru with updated details and verification info.

- Include transaction or identity proof if required.

- Tag the ticket accordingly.

### Result:
- The customer’s information is verified and accurately updated.

- Sensitive updates (like verified email or phone) are handled securely through escalation.

- Data consistency is maintained across ConnectX and the Meow Wireless platform.

- Customer confidence in data accuracy and privacy is reinforced.

### Additional Notes:
- Never change account details without confirming ownership.

- If multiple fields need updating, confirm each one clearly before saving.

- Sensitive updates (email/phone) always require escalation.

- Log every change in the ticket comments for audit purposes.

- Encourage customers to regularly review their profile to keep information current.

#### How to Check Services Included with the Plan?
*Article ID: 42171816385563 | Updated: 2025-12-17*
*URL: https://rockstarautomations.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/42171816385563-How-to-Check-Services-Included-with-the-Plan*

Updated: 

### Situation:Customers usually ask this question when they’re reviewing their plan details in the Meow Mobile app or right after activating their eSIM. Some may be confused about whether vet care is part of their mobile plan or requires a separate subscription. Others might assume the eSIM covers only mobile data and calls, not realizing that Meow Mobile integrates pet wellness services as part of its unique offering.

### Task:Before answering, the agent should verify a few key details and ensure clarity on the customer’s plan type.

- 
Verify customer details in the ConnectX panel in Zendesk first. If information is not available, proceed to ConnectX Admin:

Navigate to ConnectX > Customer360 > Enter email or contact number.

- Confirm the plan name or type under the **Products** tab.

- Check for any linked vet care package or service entitlements under their account.

- 
Ask probing questions to understand their concern:

“Have you already activated your eSIM?”

- “Are you asking about the mobile plan, the vet care services, or both?”

- “Have you tried booking a wellness check through the Meow Mobile app?”

- “Which plan did you select when signing up?"

These questions help determine if the customer’s confusion is about plan inclusions, app usage, or vet service activation.

### Action:#### If the plan details are confirmed in ConnectX:Acknowledge the question and explain what’s included based on their plan type.

- Mobile Service (eSIM):
Includes data, calls, and SMS according to their selected plan tier.

- Vet Care Perks:
Provides access to cat wellness checks (worth $50) and discounted veterinary services through Meow Mobile’s partnered clinics.

Example Response:
“Your Meow Mobile plan gives you the best of both worlds — reliable mobile service through your eSIM and wellness perks for your cat! You’ll get access to $50 worth of cat wellness checks and ongoing discounts through our partnered clinics. You can view these details or book an appointment directly in the Meow Mobile app.”

Advise the customer to keep their app updated and linked to their registered account to access all included services.

#### If plan details or vet care entitlement aren’t showing yet in ConnectX:Apologize and reassure the customer that their plan details or benefits may take time to fully sync.
Explain that activation and vet care linking may take up to 24–48 hours after eSIM activation or payment confirmation.

Example Response:
“It looks like your plan details are still syncing on our end, which can take up to **24–48 hours** after activation. Don’t worry because once everything updates, you’ll see both your mobile plan and cat care benefits reflected in your Meow Mobile app. If it’s still missing after that, we’ll get our system team to check the link between your eSIM plan and vet care perks.”

### Result:
- The customer clearly understands that their plan includes both eSIM mobile service and vet care perks.

- They know where to view these benefits (in the Meow Mobile app).

- If their plan information hasn’t synced yet, they’ve been advised of the **24–48 hour processing time** and next steps.

### Additional Notes:
- Always check ConnectX > Customer360 > Plan Details first before escalating.

- 
If the vet care service is missing in both ConnectX and the Meow Mobile app after **48 hours**:

Tag the ticket accordingly.

- Escalate to the L1 for backend review.

- Remind customers that app updates may be required for the latest plan features to display.

### Airvet - Escalation / Redirect

#### How to Handle Airvet Escalations / Redirect?
*Article ID: 42368272851483 | Updated: 2025-11-10*
*URL: https://rockstarautomations.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/42368272851483-How-to-Handle-Airvet-Escalations-Redirect*

Updated:

### Situation:Customers usually reach out with these inquiries when:

- They’re having issues inside the Airvet app (ex. unable to log in, video call not working, or missing appointment history).

- They need account actions or data updates (ex. delete or change personal info).

- They have billing or subscription questions specific to Airvet.

- They’re seeking veterinary advice or medical records from past consultations.

These requests cannot be handled by Meow Wireless support because they require direct access to Airvet’s internal systems or veterinary team.

Common examples:

- “Can you help me access my Airvet account?”

- “I need to delete or update my Airvet profile.”

- “My Airvet membership was charged incorrectly.”

- “I want a copy of my pet’s consultation records.”

- “I need to speak with a vet through Airvet.”

### Task:The agent’s goal is to:

- Identify when an inquiry involves Airvet-specific systems or veterinary support.

- Gently inform the customer that Airvet manages those functions directly.

- Guide the customer to contact Airvet Support for secure and accurate assistance.

- Reassure them that Airvet and Meow Wireless are trusted partners working together.

### Steps for Agents:#### 1. Identify if the issue belongs to AirvetCheck if the question involves:

- Airvet app access, features, or consultations.

- Medical or veterinary-related requests.

- Subscription or billing related to Airvet’s service.

- Account management or privacy (ex. delete, update, or retrieve personal data).

If yes, the case must be redirected to Airvet instead of handled internally.

#### 2. Ask clarifying questions (to confirm scope)To ensure it’s an Airvet-related issue, you may ask:

- “Are you currently using the Airvet app or the Meow Wireless app?”

- “Can you tell me what happens when you try to access your Airvet account?”

- “Was this charge for your Airvet membership or for Meow Wireless’s waitlist?”

- “Is your concern about your pet’s medical consultation or app login?”

- “Which app are you currently trying to use — Meow Wireless or Airvet?”

These questions help confirm if the user needs Airvet’s direct help.

#### 3. Advise the customer to contact Airvet directlyOnce confirmed, guide the customer in a clear and reassuring way.

Example Response:

“Thank you for reaching out! Since this involves your Airvet account and features within their app, the best way to get this resolved quickly is to contact Airvet’s dedicated Support Team.

Please email them directly at support@airvet.com using the same email address you used to sign up.

They’ll be able to securely verify your account and help with this request right away.”

If it’s a technical or medical concern:

“That sounds like something Airvet’s support team can best help you with, as they handle all app access, billing, and vet consultations directly. You can reach them at support@airvet.com.”

### Action:Next Steps for Agent:

- Confirm that the user understands they should contact Airvet.

- Provide the correct contact email or app path.

- Add an internal note (ex. “Customer redirected to Airvet Support”).

- Tag the ticket accordingly.

- Close the interaction with a helpful and polite tone.

### Result:
- Customers are properly guided to Airvet for faster, expert assistance.

- Meow Wireless support avoids handling protected or system-specific data.

- Communication remains clear, helpful, and consistent.

- The partnership between Meow Wireless and Airvet is reinforced through a seamless redirection process.

### Additional Notes:Redirect to Airvet if:

- The inquiry involves app access, login, consultations, billing, or account deletion.

- The customer needs veterinary or medical-related help.

- Any data or action involves Airvet’s internal system or vet team.

Do not attempt to:

- Troubleshoot Airvet app errors beyond general suggestions (update, reinstall, retry).

- Access or modify Airvet user accounts.

- Promise refunds or changes within the Airvet platform.

## Port-in and Port-out

### Port-out Procedure

#### Carrier-wise number port out ability check
*Article ID: 44754208880795 | Updated: 2025-12-24*
*URL: https://rockstarautomations.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/44754208880795-Carrier-wise-number-port-out-ability-check*

### **AT&T **
### **1. How to Check Your Contract Status**Most modern AT&T plans are "no-contract," but you may still have a **Service Commitment** (from an older plan) or an **Installment Plan** (paying off a phone).

- **Via myAT&T App/Web:**Log in to your Account Overview.
Go to My Wireless.
Select the device you want to check and click Manage device & features.
Scroll to the bottom. You will see a Service commitment end date if you are under a traditional contract.

- **Checking Device Balance:**Under the same Manage device section, look for Installment plan details. If you owe money on the phone itself, you must pay the remaining balance in full before the device can be "unlocked" for another carrier.

Via Short Code: Dial *225# from your AT&T phone. You will receive a text message with your current balance and basic account info, though it may not show full installment details.

Via Phone: Call AT&T Customer Service at 800-331-0500 or dial 611 from your mobile device and ask for your "contract or installment end date."

### ### **2. Your Ability to Port Out**Legally, per FCC rules, AT&T **cannot refuse** to port your number to another carrier, even if you owe a balance or are under contract. However, there are financial and technical catches:

- 
**Financial Impact:** If you port out while under contract, AT&T will charge an **Early Termination Fee (ETF)**. If you are on an installment plan, the **entire remaining balance** of the phone becomes due immediately on your final bill.
- 
**Device Locking:** Your phone will remain "locked" to AT&T's network until it is paid off in full. You can port your *number* to a new phone on another carrier anytime, but you can't use your *current AT&T phone* elsewhere until the balance is zero.
- 
**Account Status:** Your account must be **active** to port. **Do not cancel** your AT&T service yourself; the porting process with your new carrier will automatically cancel the AT&T line once it's finished.
### ### **3. What You Need to Port Your Number**To move your number, you will need three specific pieces of information to give to your new carrier:

- 
**Account Number:** Found at the top of your paper bill or under "Profile" in the app.
- 
**Transfer PIN:** You must request a **Number Transfer PIN** (this is different from your account passcode).

**Quick Way:** Dial **#PORT** (**#7678**) from your AT&T phone.
- 
**App Way:** Go to **Profile** > **Settings** > **Transfer phone number** > **Request a new PIN**.

- 
**Account ZIP Code:** The billing ZIP code associated with your AT&T account.### **Important Tip : **Before you start the port, check if you have **"Wireless Account Lock"** enabled in your security settings. If this is "On," it will block any transfer attempts until you toggle it

### ### **Verizon**### **1. How to Check Your Status**You can see if you are still paying for a device or have a legacy contract through these steps:

- 
**Via the My Verizon App:**
Tap the **Account** tab at the bottom.
- Go to **Devices** and select your specific phone line.
- Look for the **Device payment** section. If you see a remaining balance and a "Pay off device" option, you have an active installment plan.

- 
**Via the Verizon Website:**
Log in and go to **Account > My devices > Device Overview**.
- Select your device; the **Contract End Date** or **Device Payment Plan** details will be listed near the top left, next to the image of your phone.

- **Via Phone:** Call **800-922-0204** or dial **611** from your mobile device.
 

### **2. Can You Port Your Number Out?****Yes.** Under FCC rules, Verizon cannot refuse a port request, even if you owe money on your bill or a device. However, there is a common "blocker" specific to Verizon that you must handle first:

- 
**Number Lock (Port Protection):** Verizon has a security feature called **Number Lock** that is often enabled to prevent fraud. **If this is ON, your port will fail.****How to disable it:** In the My Verizon app or website, go to **Account > Account Settings > Security Settings** and toggle **Number Lock** to **Off** for the line you want to move.

- **Financial Impact:** As soon as you port your number, any remaining balance on your device payment plan will be accelerated and added to your **final bill** immediately.
 

### **3. Requirements for a Verizon Port**To move your number to a new carrier, you will need:

- 
**Account Number:** Found on your bill or under **Account Overview** online. It usually ends in -00001.

- 
**Number Transfer PIN:** Verizon does *not* use your account password for porting. You must generate a unique 6-digit PIN.

**The Shortcut:** Dial **#PORT**** (****#7678****)** from your Verizon phone. They will text you a link to generate the PIN.

- **Manual:** In the app/website, go to **Profile > Number Transfer PIN > Generate PIN**.

- **Active Line:** Your service must be active at the moment the new carrier requests the transfer.
**Pro-Tip:** Verizon devices are usually automatically unlocked 60 days after purchase, but only if they are not flagged for fraud. If you haven't hit that 60-day mark, your phone may remain locked to Verizon even after you port the number.

 

**T-Mobile**

### **1. How to Check Your T-Mobile Status**To see if you still owe money on a device or have a specific agreement:

- 
**Via the T-Life App (formerly T-Mobile App):**
Open the **Manage** tab.
- Select your plan or the specific line you want to check.
- Look for **"Installment plan details"** or **"Equipment"**. It will show you your remaining balance and how many payments are left.

 

- 
**Via the T-Mobile Website:**
1. Log in and go to your **Account Overview**.
2. Scroll to **"Lines and Devices"** and click on your device. 
3. Select **"View installment plan"** to see your remaining balance.

 
- 
**Via Short Code:** Dial **#BAL#**** (****#225#****)** on your keypad to see your current account balance. To check device-specific info, you usually need to use the app or website.
 

### **2. Can T-Mobile Block Your Port?****No.** Legally, T-Mobile cannot block you from porting your number to another carrier, even if you have a past-due balance or an unpaid device. However, there is **one specific setting** that might *technically* block the process until you turn it off:

- 
**Port Out Protection:** T-Mobile offers a security feature called "Port Out Protection" (sometimes called "Takeover Protection"). If this is enabled on your line, any porting request will be automatically rejected. You must disable this in the app or website under **Profile > Privacy and Notifications** before you can leave.
- 
**Financial Impact:** Just like with AT&T, once you port your number, any remaining device balance (EIP) becomes **due immediately** on your final bill.
 

### **3. Requirements to Port Out of T-Mobile**To successfully move your number, you will need three things:

- 
**Account Number:** Found at the top of your PDF bill or on your online dashboard.
- 
**Number Transfer PIN:** T-Mobile uses a specific "Temporary Port Out PIN" that is different from your account password.
**How to get it:** In the T-Life app or website, go to **Profile > Settings > Line Settings > Request a Transfer PIN**.

- 
**Account Status:** Keep your line active until the port is finished.
**Note on Device Unlocking:** If you still owe money on your phone, T-Mobile will keep the *device* locked to their network. Even after you port your number, you won't be able to use that phone with another carrier until the balance is paid and you request an unlock.
 

### **Cricket Wireless **

**1. Verify "Contract" and Financial Status**Cricket Wireless does not use annual service contracts. However, users must verify two specific areas of obligation:

- Service Payments: Since Cricket is prepaid, you do not have "Early Termination Fees." You simply stop paying for the next month.
- 
Device Unlock Eligibility: If you purchased your phone from Cricket, it is likely locked to their network.
The Rule: The device must have been active on Cricket service for at least 6 months to be eligible for an unlock.
- How to Check: Open the myCricket App > Settings > Device Unlock. If eligible, you can request the unlock directly there.

## **2. Pre-Port Requirements (Mandatory)**A port request will be automatically rejected by Cricket if these two security features are not addressed:

### **A. Disable Account Lock**Cricket's "Account Lock" feature protects you from unauthorized transfers. It must be turned OFF before the new carrier requests your number.

- Open the myCricket App.
- Tap the Gear Icon (Settings) in the top right.
- Select Account Lock.
- Toggle the setting to OFF. (You will receive a one-time PIN via text to verify this change).
### **B. Obtain a Number Transfer PIN**You cannot use your standard 4-digit account PIN to port out. You must generate a unique, temporary Number Transfer PIN.

- 
Option 1 (Fastest): Dial *PORT (*7678) from your Cricket phone and follow the prompts.

- Option 2 (App): Go to Settings > Line Settings > Get my Number Transfer PIN.
- Validity: This PIN is valid for 5 days.
## 
**3. Execution Checklist for Porting****Gather the following data before contacting Meow Mobile:**

**Phone Number**
**Your 10-digit Cricket mobile number.**

**Account Number**
**Found in the myCricket App under "Account Summary" (9 digits).**

## **4. Finalizing the Transfer**
- Do Not Cancel: Ensure your Cricket account remains active. If you cancel your account manually before the transfer is finished, you will lose your number.

### **Mint Mobile**

**1. Identify "Contractual" Obligations**Since Mint Mobile is prepaid, your "contract" is simply the duration of the plan you purchased.

- **Step 1.1: **Log in to the Mint Mobile App.
- **Step 1.2: **View the "My Plan" section.
- 
**Step 1.3: **Note your Plan End Date.

 ***Note:***** **You can port out at any time before this date, but Mint Mobile does not offer pro-rated refunds for unused months.

### **2. Verify Device "Lock" Status**Even if your number is ready to port, your phone might be restricted if you purchased it directly from Mint.

- **Step 2.1: **If you brought your own device (BYOP), it is already unlocked. Skip to Section 3.
- **Step 2.2: **If you bought your phone from Mint, check the Unlock Policy. Mint typically requires the device to have been active on their service for 12 months before they will unlock it for use with another carrier.
- **Step 2.3: **To request an unlock, contact Mint Support at (800) 683-7392.
### **3. Confirm Porting Eligibility**The FCC mandates that carriers cannot "hold your number hostage" due to unpaid balances or pending time on a plan.

- **Criteria A: **Your account must be active. Do not cancel your Mint service before the port is finished, or you will lose the number.
- **Criteria B: **Ensure you have no "Number Lock" enabled in the Account Settings > Security tab of the app.
### 
**US Mobile**

**1. Verify "Contract" and Device Status**
- There are no service contracts or early termination fees (ETFs). You pay for your plan upfront; if you port out before your 30-day cycle ends, you simply forfeit the remaining days.
- 
**Device Lock Status:**
BYOP (Bring Your Own Phone): If you brought your own device to US Mobile, it is already unlocked.
- Purchased from US Mobile: Most devices sold by US Mobile are unlocked. However, if you purchased a device under a specific promotional "lock" term, it generally unlocks automatically after 60 days of continuous service. You can check this in the App > Shop > My Orders.

## **2. Mandatory Pre-Port Actions (Security)**US Mobile does not display porting information in their app or dashboard for security reasons. You must contact their support team to have the information generated and the "port-out" manually authorized.

### **A. Disable Internal Security Locks**Before a port can be initiated, you must ensure your account is authorized for a move.

- **Step:** Contact US Mobile Support (via Live Chat or 611) and ask them to "Disable the Port-Out Lock" for your specific line. They will verify your identity before toggling this off.### **B. Retrieve Account Number and Port PIN****You cannot use your standard account password or login PIN to port out.**

- **Contact Method 1 (Fastest):** Use the 24/7 Live Chat on the US Mobile website or in the app.
- 
**Contact Method 2:** Email help@usmobile.com or call (878) 205-0088.

 
- **Requirement:** State clearly:** *****"I need my Account Number and Port-Out PIN for the purpose of a number transfer."***** **They will send this sensitive data to your registered email address.

### 
**Xfinity Mobile**

**1. ****Verify Contract vs. Device Balance**Xfinity Mobile plans are month-to-month with no long-term service contracts. Your primary obligation is likely your device.

- 
**Check Device Status:**
1. Log in to the Xfinity App or[ online portal](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.xfinity.com/mobile/my-account/devices).
2. Select the Services tab, then tap Mobile lines and data usage. 
3. Select the specific device line. 
4. Look for "Payment Details". If you have a remaining balance, porting the number out will cause that balance to be accelerated, meaning the full remaining cost of the phone will appear on your next bill.

- Service Billing: Xfinity does not pro-rate "By the Gig" plans. If you port out in the middle of a cycle, you are charged for the full gigabytes used up to that point.
## **2. Mandatory Pre-Port Actions (Security)**Xfinity Mobile uses two distinct security layers that will cause a port to fail if not addressed.

### **A. Disable Number Lock**Xfinity has a fraud-prevention feature called Number Lock. It is often enabled by default.

- Open the Xfinity App and sign in.
- Tap the Services tab > Mobile lines and data usage.
- Tap the line you wish to transfer.
- Scroll to the Line management section and tap Number Lock.
- Toggle the switch to OFF. (You will receive a confirmation email once this is done).
### **B. Generate a Security (Transfer) PIN**You must generate a unique PIN specifically for porting. Do not use your account login password.

- Via App: 1. Navigate to the line you want to transfer (same as Step A). 2. Tap Transfer or cancel this line. 3. Select Get started and follow the prompts. 4. Xfinity will send a 6-digit PIN to that line via text.
- Validity: This PIN is valid for 24 hours. If you do not initiate the port within a day, you must generate a new one.
### 
**Visible**

**1. Verify Financial Status and Device Locking**Visible is a strictly prepaid service. Your only "contractual" obligations are related to the hardware or the current month's payment.

- **Service Payments: **You pay for your service 30 days in advance. If you port out in the middle of a month, you will not receive a pro-rated refund for the remaining days.
- 
**Device Unlock Status:**
If you brought your own phone to Visible, it is already unlocked.
- If you purchased a phone from Visible, it is automatically unlocked 60 days after activation. You do not need to submit a request; it happens over-the-air once the 60-day requirement is met and the device is paid in full.

- **Device Balances:** If you financed your phone through Visible's partner (Affirm), your loan agreement is separate from your phone service. Porting your number does not cancel your loan; you must continue making payments to Affirm as scheduled.
## **2. Mandatory Pre-Port Actions (Security)**Visible has a high-security "Number Lock" feature that will cause a port-out request to be immediately rejected by their system if not toggled off.

### **A. Disable Line Lock (Number Lock)**
- 
Open the Visible App or log in to your[ account online](https://www.visible.com/sign-in).

- Navigate to the Account section (on the app) or the Profile tab (on desktop).
- Look for Privacy & Security and select Manage Number Security.
- Locate Line Lock and ensure it is toggled to OFF (Unlocked).
- You may be asked to enter a security code sent to your email or phone to confirm this change.
### **B. Retrieve Your Port-Out PIN**Visible generates a unique 6-digit PIN for transfers. Do not use your account password or your SIM PIN.

- In the same Account/Profile section used above, find the Port-Out PIN button.
- Select Request via email.
- Visible will send an email containing your Account Number and your 6-digit Port-Out PIN.
- Validity: This PIN is valid for 7 days. If you do not port within a week, you must request a new one.
### 
**Google Fi**

**1. Verify Contract and Financial Status**Google Fi does not use annual service contracts. However, users must check for "Equipment" or "Promotion" obligations that could lead to a large final bill.

**Check for Device Financing: **
1. Log in to the Google Fi App or[ ](https://fi.google.com)[fi.google.com](http://fi.google.com).
2. Go to the Billing tab and select Manage device payments. 
3. If you have a remaining balance, the full amount will be charged to your Google Payments account once the port is successful.

 
- 
**Check Promotional Status: **
1. If you received a discount on a phone (e.g., "$500 off via 24 monthly credits"), porting out before the 24 months are up will void the remaining credits.
2. You will be billed for the "un-rebated" portion of the device's original price.

## **2. Mandatory Pre-Port Actions (Security)**Google Fi does not show your Account Number or Transfer PIN on your main dashboard. You must go through a specific "cancellation flow" to reveal this information. This will not cancel your service immediately.

### **Retrieve Account Number and Transfer PIN**

- On the Account tab, select Manage plan.
- Scroll to the bottom and select Leave Google Fi.
- Follow the on-screen prompts (Google will ask why you are leaving).

- If you brought your own phone (BYOP): Your Account Number is typically the last 15 digits of your SIM card number (ICCID).
### **C. Obtain a Number Transfer PIN (NTP)**You cannot use your standard 4-digit security PIN to port out. You must generate a temporary 4-digit Number Transfer PIN.

- Choose your device to see the **Remaining Balance**.

- **Financial Impact:** If you port your number while you still owe money on a phone, the **entire remaining balance becomes due immediately** on your final bill.
- **Internet Dependency:** Note that if you cancel your Spectrum Internet service but keep Spectrum Mobile, your mobile bill will increase by an "unbundled" service fee (typically $10+ per line).
## **2. Mandatory Pre-Port Actions (Security)**Spectrum Mobile protects numbers with a security lock. You must generate a specific PIN to bypass this before the new carrier can take the number.

### **A. Disable Port-Out Locks**If you have previously called Spectrum to "lock" your number for security, you must call **(833) 224-6603** to have the representative remove the manual port-protection lock.

- 
**Check Plan Expiration:** Text the word bal to 327986787 from your handset to see your current balance and service end date.

## **2. Mandatory Pre-Port Actions (Security)**H2O Wireless does not display porting credentials (Account Number and PIN) in your online account dashboard or mobile app. To protect against "SIM swapping" fraud, they require a manual verification process.

### **A. Prepare for Verification**H2O will require you to verify your identity by providing the 3 most recent outgoing calls you made from your phone. Have these numbers ready before you contact them.

### **B. Retrieve Account Number and Porting PIN**You must contact the H2O Porting Department directly to have your number "released" for transfer.

**Check Device Status:** 1. Log in to the My CC App or your[ online account](https://www.consumercellular.com/login). 2. Check your Equipment or Installment Plan status. 3. If you have an outstanding balance on an EasyPay installment plan, porting your number will cause the remaining balance to be due immediately on your final bill.

### **C Spire**

**1. Verify Contract and Financial Status**C Spire is a regional carrier that still utilizes traditional service contracts for some legacy plans and device promotions.

- **Check Your Status**: Log in to the My C Spire app or website. Navigate to Account > Plan Details. Look specifically for a "Contract End Date" or "Device Installment Balance."
- **Financial Obligations**: If you are under a legacy 2-year contract, porting out before the end date will trigger an Early Termination Fee (ETF). If you have a device payment plan, the remaining balance will be charged in full on your final bill.
- **Device Locking**: C Spire typically locks devices for 60 days after activation. If you are porting out after this period and the phone is paid off, it should be eligible for unlocking via their support line at (855) 277-4734.
## **2. Mandatory Pre-Port Actions (Security)**C Spire does not have a "Number Lock" toggle in the app, but they require specific credentials that are often misunderstood.

- **Account Number**: This is a 10-digit number found on the top right of your paper bill or under "Account Summary" in the app.
- **Port-Out PIN**: Unlike larger carriers, C Spire does not always generate a temporary PIN. In most cases, your Account Security PIN (the 4-digit code you use to verify your identity with support) serves as your Transfer PIN. If you do not have one set, call 611 to establish it before attempting the port.

### 
**Dish (Project Genesis) **

**1. Verify Contract Status**Project Genesis is a month-to-month, "early-access" 5G service. There are no service contracts.

- **Device Financing:** Most Project Genesis users bought their hardware outright or are on a specific trial. Check your original order email to confirm if you have any remaining device obligations.
## **2. Mandatory Pre-Port Actions (Security)**Because Project Genesis is a specialized network, the porting process is highly manual and handled through their specific support team.

- **Retrieving Info:** You cannot find your Porting PIN in the app. You must use the In-App Chat or call the Project Genesis support line directly.
- **The "Manual Release"**: Once you have the PIN and provide it to your new carrier, Dish often requires a manual "release" from their porting department. It is recommended to stay in the chat with a representative until the new carrier confirms they have received the number.

 

### **Boost Mobile **

**1. Verify Status and "Contract"**Boost Mobile is strictly no-contract. However, since the acquisition by Dish, many users were moved to a new billing system.

- 
**Check Your System:** If you use the Boost One app, you are on the new system. If you use the older My Boost app, you are a legacy customer.

 
- **Device Payments:** If you are on "Boost Infinite," check for device financing. Like other carriers, the balance is due immediately upon port-out.
## 2. **Mandatory Pre-Port Actions (Security)**

## **2. Mandatory Pre-Port Actions (Security)**Ultra Mobile requires a manual request for porting credentials to ensure the account owner is the one making the move.

- **Account Number:** Found in the Account Details section of the Ultra Mobile app or web portal.
- **Transfer PIN:** This is not your account password. You must call Ultra Mobile at (888) 777-0446 or use their Online Chat to speak with a representative.

### Port-in troubleshooting

#### Port-in/eSIM Error Codes and Rejections
*Article ID: 44457984778651 | Updated: 2025-12-19*
*URL: https://rockstarautomations.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/44457984778651-Port-in-eSIM-Error-Codes-and-Rejections*

**Port-in/eSIM Error Codes and Rejections**

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the L0 actions for various e-SIM installation and port-in rejection errors, based on the provided error code details.

### **1.  Probing and Empathy**
- Acknowledge the frustration and confirm the exact error code or message the customer is receiving.
- Gather details: Device Model and current Operating System (OS) version.
- Obtain an Alternate Contact Number if the current line is completely non-functional.
### **2.  L0 Probing with the Customer**The following errors are typically resolved by guiding the customer through an action on their device:

- 
**ERROR_CARRIER_LOCKED**** (Device is locked by another carrier):**Action: Inform the customer that their device is locked by the previous carrier. They need to contact that carrier to unlock it or use another unlocked device before trying e-SIM again.

- 
**ERROR_EUICC_INSUFFICIENT_MEMORY**** (Insufficient memory for new profile):**
**Action:** Guide the subscriber to the Cellular/Mobile Data settings. Ask them to delete any unused or old e-SIM profiles to free up memory, and then retry the installation process

***Setting>>Mobile Service>>Cellular Plans" or "SIMs>>Delete e-SIM (or Remove Cellular Plan). Confirm the action when prompted. ***

- 
**ERROR_EUICC_MISSING**** (e-SIM not supported or module is defective):**
**Action: **Advise the subscriber that the device either does not support e-SIM or has a hardware issue. Ask them to try installing the e-SIM on a different, confirmed e-SIM-compatible device and then retry the installation.

- 
**ERROR_INCOMPATIBLE_CARRIER**** (LPA on device is incompatible):**
**Action: **Ask the subscriber to ensure their device Operating System (OS) is updated to the latest available version. Once updated, they should retry the installation/activation process.
 

- 
**ERROR_TIME_OUT**** (Operation timed out):**
**Action: **Advise the subscriber that the connection timed out. Ask them to wait for 5-10 minutes and then retry the installation process, ensuring they have a stable Wi-Fi connection.

### **3. ⬆️ Escalation to L1 (Backend/System Errors)****The following errors require intervention from L1/Technical Support, as they relate to profile generation, system configuration, or carrier certificates. L0 Action: escalate Ticket to L1 with all necessary details.**

- 
**EMBEDDED_SUBSCRIPTION_RESULT_ERROR**** (Missing carrier privilege certificate):**
**Action:** Raise the Zendesk Ticket to L1.

- 
**ERROR_ADDRESS_MISSING**** (Incorrect e-SIM activation string):**
**Action**: Raise the Zendesk Ticket to L1.

- 
**ERROR_DISALLOWED_BY_PPR**** (e-SIM profile policy rules preventing installation):**
**Action:** Raise the Zendesk Ticket to L1.

- 
**ERROR_NO_PROFILES_AVAILABLE**** (e-SIM profile not available on SMDP+):**
**Action: **Raise the Zendesk Ticket to L1

### **4. 📝 Documentation and Hand-off**
- For all cases, meticulously document the specific error code, the customer's device model/OS, and the action taken (either L0 self-service or L1 escalation).
- Required details by L1:
Registered Mobile Number
- Device Make & Model
- OS Version
- Device IMEI (SIM Slot 1 & 2)
- Date & Time of Issue
- Location (State/City/Area)
- Error Messages / Screenshots"

### eSIM Activation & Set Up

#### How to Check if eSIM is Already Activated?
*Article ID: 44463392211739 | Updated: 2025-12-16*
*URL: https://rockstarautomations.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/44463392211739-How-to-Check-if-eSIM-is-Already-Activated*

Updated:

### Situation:Customers usually ask this question after signing up for Meow Wireless and receiving their eSIM activation email.
They may be:

- Unsure how to install or scan the QR code.

- Trying to activate on a device that’s not eSIM-compatible.

- Reporting that they didn’t receive their activation link or email.

Agents should be familiar with the basic steps of eSIM setup and the resources available in ConnectX for troubleshooting activation issues.

### Task:The agent’s goal is to guide the customer through eSIM activation, confirm whether their device supports eSIM, and ensure the activation completes successfully. If activation fails or the email hasn’t arrived, the agent should verify the account status in ConnectX.

### Steps for Agents:#### 1. Verify customer details in the ConnectX panel in Zendesk first. If information is not available, proceed to ConnectX Admin:
- Go to ConnectX > Customer360.

- Search by email or phone number.

- Check the Account Status and ensure that the eSIM has been issued **(status: “Activation Pending” or “Activated”)**.

- Confirm that the activation link or QR code was sent to the registered email.

#### 2. Ask clarifying questions:
- “Have you received your eSIM activation email from Meow Wireless?”

- “Are you using an eSIM-compatible device?”

- “Did you already scan the QR code or try the activation link?”

- “Are you seeing any specific error message during setup?”

These questions help identify if the issue is with email delivery, device compatibility, or activation failure.

### Action:If the customer received the activation email but hasn’t installed the eSIM yet:

Guide them through the standard activation steps.

Example Response:
“Thanks for confirming! You can activate your Meow Wireless eSIM by following these steps:

- Open the email from Meow Wireless containing your eSIM QR code.

- On your phone, go to Settings > Cellular/Mobile Network > Add eSIM.

- Scan the QR code or enter the activation details manually.

- Wait for your device to complete setup — this usually takes just a few minutes.
Once installed, your Meow Wireless service will automatically activate and you’ll see our network appear on your phone.”

Next Steps for Agent:

- Confirm activation completion in ConnectX (status: “Active”).

- Tag the ticket accordingly.

If the customer hasn’t received their eSIM activation email:

Check whether it was sent or delayed.

Example Response:
“I see that your eSIM activation email hasn’t arrived yet — no worries! Sometimes it takes up to 30 minutes to appear in your inbox or spam folder. If you still don’t see it, I’ll request a resend for you.”

Next Steps for Agent:

- Confirm email address on file.

- **Request resend via ConnectX → ****Actions > Resend Activation Email****.**

- Advise the customer to check all folders (Inbox, Spam, Promotions).

- Tag ticket accordingly.

If the customer reports that activation failed:

Verify device compatibility and escalate if needed.

Example Response:
“Thanks for letting us know. If your device showed an error during eSIM setup, it could be due to compatibility or connection issues. Let’s try reinstalling:

- Remove the previous eSIM attempt from your phone’s settings.

- Restart your device.

- Re-scan the QR code or click the activation link again.
If it still doesn’t activate, we’ll escalate this to our Technical Team for manual provisioning.”

Next Steps for Agent:

- **Check device compatibility in ConnectX (supported device list).**

- **If reinstallation fails, escalate to **L1 → eSIM Activation Issue**.**

- **Advise the customer of a **24–48 hour turnaround time** for resolution.**

- Tag ticket accordingly.

### Result:
- The customer successfully activates their Meow Wireless eSIM or receives clear next steps.

- Delayed or failed activations are escalated properly through ConnectX.

- The customer gains immediate access to network service and Meow Wireless benefits.

### Additional Notes:
- Never resend QR codes manually outside ConnectX.

- Always verify device compatibility before troubleshooting further.

- Escalate only if activation remains unposted after 48 hours or repeated failure occurs.

- Confirm email and device information carefully before proceeding.

- The suspension is delayed (e.g., set to happen after 6 hours).
- If the customer pays manually *before* the scheduled suspension time:
The manual payment is processed.
- The suspension will be prevented, and the customer will never be suspended.

- If payment fails, the customer can be sent a **payment link** via email or chat to manually pay. The customer must then pay manually.

#### eSIM Device Compatibility Check
*Article ID: 44455336528667 | Updated: 2025-12-19*
*URL: https://rockstarautomations.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/44455336528667-eSIM-Device-Compatibility-Check*

## **SOP - eSIM Device Compatibility Check**This SOP outlines the steps an L0 agent should take to confirm if a customer's device supports eSIM technology and is ready for activation.

- **Probing and Empathy - **
- Acknowledge the importance of device compatibility: "That's a great question; let's confirm your device is ready for eSIM."
- 
Ask the customer for the **exact device name and model number** (e.g., iPhone 13 Pro, Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, Google Pixel 7).

 

- ### **External Compatibility Check - **
- Use the internal **Device Compatibility Database (eSIM compatibility Sheet - **[**Device List**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aQprKiTQjvw90TwCjrybco-D8uRrYG4AbikX0cZuVec/edit?gid=0#gid=0)**)** to search for the specific model provided by the customer.
- You can also refer to Google to determine device eSIM compatibility.
- 
**Confirm two key criteria:**
The model is listed as **eSIM compatible**.
- 
The device is **unlocked** (or locked to *this* carrier).

 

- ### **Internal Device Verification (Guided Customer Check) - **
- Guide the customer to check the device settings themselves, as this verifies the physical eSIM component is functional and ready.
- 
**For iPhone (iOS):**
Go to **Settings** — **General** — **About**.
- Look for the **"EID"** (Embedded Identity Document) number.
- 
**If EID is present:** The device is eSIM-compatible.
- 
**If EID is missing or says "Unavailable":** The device may not support eSIM or the feature is disabled (often the case for some region-specific models, e.g., dual-physical SIM models).

- 
**For Android (Varies by Manufacturer):**

**Method 1 (Samsung/Pixel):** Go to **Settings** — **Connections/Network & Internet** – **SIM Card Manager/Mobile Network**.
- Look for an option like **"Add mobile plan"** or **"Add eSIM."**

- 
**Method 2 (General):** Dial ***#06#** on the phone app.
- Look for the **"EID"** number displayed on the screen.
- 
**If the option/EID is present:** The device is eSIM-compatible.

 

- **Conclusion and Next Steps - **
- 
**Case A: Device is Compatible:**
**Action:** Confirm the device supports eSIM and proceed directly to the eSIM QR code delivery or activation process.

- 
**Case B: Device is NOT Compatible (No EID/Not on List):**

**Action:** Politely inform the customer that based on the model or the check results, the device does not appear to support eSIM functionality.
- 
**Suggestion:** Advise the customer to confirm with the device manufacturer or use a different, known-compatible device.

**L0 Action -**

### **Step 1 - Probing, Empathizing with the customer**
- **Acknowledge the concern and assure assistance**
- 
**Confirm:**

**Has this code been scanned before?** Even once? (e.g., "Did you try scanning it yesterday and it failed, or is this the very first try?")

**Step 3 - Troubleshooting Steps to be done (L0) - Refer to **[**Troubleshooting Guide**](https://rockstarautomations.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/44455761075099)

- 
**Check internal notes on the account in **[**ConnectX**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-rfMRbeoi3NYOiNDXZewcLf3w9Ii5KQv4N7ZCcuhdvg/edit?tab=t.0)

**Verify Order Date:** Check when the eSIM was purchased. 

(QR can be scanned only once, even if the activation was not successful)

- 
**Verify Activation Status : eSIM status on **[**ConnectX**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k7ihp0sC5sig2ex0ZQjXg8bywu8CUpNyTzHiPzS_qUc/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.r621ahwcme2v)

- 
**Check Device Model in History : **Did the customer recently mention switching phones or upgrading their device?
- 
**The "Already Installed" Check**

*iPhone:* Settings > Cellular. Look under "SIMs". Is there a line with no number, or labeled "Secondary"? Tap it and check if the ICCID matches the order.
- 
*Android:* Settings > Network & Internet > SIMs. Look for "Downloaded SIM" or a generic carrier name.
- 
*If found:* The error is correct. The user just needs to **Turn On** that line and enable Roaming. They do *not* need to scan again.

- 
**Check Internet Connection**Ensure the user is on strong Wi-Fi. A dropped packet during the first handshake can sometimes "burn" the code without finishing the install on the phone.

- 
**Device Compatibility Check**Verify the device is **Carrier Unlocked** (Settings > General > About > Carrier Lock: "No SIM restrictions"). Locked phones often throw generic "Invalid Plan" or "Expired" errors.

- 
**Restart Device**Restarting clears a temporary cache that might be blocking the camera from recognizing the code format.

### **Step 4 - Re-issuing a new e-SIM to the customer from ConnectX. - Refer to **[**eSIM QR Code Generation**](https://rockstarautomations.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/44454985470747)- As the QR has expired or is not working, we can go ahead and re-issue a new QR code. ### 
 

### **Step 5 - Escalate to L1:**
If the issue still persists after re-issuing a new e-SIM, this issue must be escalated to L1 to further check all the details.
- Ensure all mandatory fields are completed
- Set correct **Ticket Priority based on impact***** (High)***

- Add detailed **internal notes (Zendesk)**

- Attach all screenshots and customer confirmations
- Change ticket status to **On-hold if escalated to L1**

- Activation **Attempt Statu**s (Success/Failure/Error)
- 
**Date & time the QR code **was sent
- Are they trying to move the** eSIM** to a new phone? Yes/No

#### How to Check Missed Payments?
*Article ID: 42174101294107 | Updated: 2025-12-18*
*URL: https://rockstarautomations.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/42174101294107-How-to-Check-Missed-Payments*

Updated:

### Situation:Customers typically ask this question when they’ve received a payment reminder, see a “Pending” or “Suspended” status in the Meow Wireless app, or experience restricted service.
In some cases, they might have missed their billing due date or had a failed auto-payment.

Agents may also encounter cases where the customer insists they already paid, but the system doesn’t show it — requiring verification and potential escalation.

### Task:The agent’s goal is to determine whether the missed payment is due to a delay, a failed transaction, or a genuine non-payment, and guide the customer to resolve it.

Steps for Agents:

- 
Check the customer’s account in ConnectX:

Go to ConnectX > Customer360 > Search by email or phone number.

- Review the Account Status (Active, Pending, or Suspended).

- 
Open the Billing or Payments tab to check for:

Payment due date

- Outstanding balance

- Last successful payment date

- Failed transaction attempts (if any)

- 
Ask clarifying questions:

“Have you received a payment reminder or notification from Meow Wireless?”

- “When did you last make a payment?”

- “Which payment method did you use — card, wallet, or other?”

- “Did you receive a confirmation email or in-app message after payment?”

- “Are you currently seeing a suspended or limited access message in your Meow Wireless app?”

These questions help confirm whether the issue is due to non-payment, delayed posting, or system error.

### Action:#### If the payment is overdue (no recent transaction found):Explain the consequences of the missed payment and how to resolve it promptly.

Example Response:
“It looks like your last payment hasn’t been completed yet, which is why your account may be temporarily limited. You can quickly restore full access by paying your outstanding balance through the Meow Wireless app. Once payment is confirmed, your services should reactivate automatically within a few minutes.”

Next Steps for Agent:

- Advise the customer to complete payment immediately via the Meow Wireless app.

- Remind them that delays beyond **7 days** may lead to service suspension.

- Tag the ticket accordingly.

#### If the customer claims payment was already made but it’s not visible in ConnectX:Acknowledge their concern and verify whether the payment is still processing or failed.

Example Response:
“Thanks for letting us know! I don’t see the payment reflected yet, but sometimes it can take up to 24–48 hours depending on your payment provider. Could you please share a screenshot or transaction reference number so we can verify it?”

Next Steps for Agent:

- Request proof of payment (screenshot or receipt).

- Check payment status.

- Escalate if payment remains unposted after 48 hours.

- Advise turnaround time of 24–48 hours for verification.

#### If the account is already suspended due to multiple missed payments:Explain the status clearly and provide reactivation steps.

Example Response:
“It looks like your account is currently suspended due to missed payments. The good news is, you can easily reactivate your service — just settle the outstanding balance in your Meow Wireless app. Once payment is completed, your account will automatically be reactivated within a few minutes.”

Next Steps for Agent:

- Confirm the outstanding balance.

- Advise that services will be restored after payment confirmation.

- Add a note to monitor account status change.

- Tag ticket accordingly.

### Result:
- The customer understands the impact of missed payments on their service.

- They know how to resolve the issue quickly via the Meow Wireless app.

- Any unclear or disputed payments are escalated and verified properly.

### Additional Notes:
- Do not manually reactivate or adjust credits — all updates must go through billing verification.

- Always verify that payment and account details match before escalating.

- Avoid confirming payment success without proof of transaction.

- 
**Escalate if:**

**Payment remains unposted after 48 hours.**

- **There’s a system mismatch between ConnectX and the Meow Wireless app.**

- **The customer reports multiple failed transactions.**

### Zendesk

#### Using Macros & Shortcuts
*Article ID: 44559136955803 | Updated: 2025-12-18*
*URL: https://rockstarautomations.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/44559136955803-Using-Macros-Shortcuts*

## **Zendesk SOP – Using Macros & Shortcuts**## **Purpose**This SOP explains how Zendesk agents should use **Macros** and **Shortcuts** to respond faster, maintain accuracy, and ensure a consistent Meow Mobile customer experience.

## **What Are Macros?**Macros are **pre-written canned responses** created for common customer questions, greetings, closing or scenarios. They help you reduce typing time, avoid errors, and maintain a consistent brand tone.

**Key points:**

- **Macros can only be used on email tickets.**
- Macros insert full responses instantly
- They may include instructions, troubleshooting steps, or next actions
- Macros are templates and must be reviewed before sending
## **What Are Shortcuts?**Shortcuts are **keyboard-triggered quick replies** (e.g., typing “/” “forward slash” followed by key phrase to pull up a response). They serve the same purpose as Macros but are faster to access during **live chats**.

**Key points:**

- **Shortcuts can only be used on Live Chats.**
- Shortcuts speed up live conversations
- They pull approved canned responses, Opening and Closing.
- Content must still be verified before sending
## **When to Use Macros or Shortcuts**Agents should use macros or shortcuts when:

- Greeting the Customer to reduce **FRT.**

- The customer issue is common or repetitive
- The question has a predefined, approved response
- Accuracy and consistency are important
- Speed is required (especially during live chat)
**Examples of suitable use cases:**

- Network or data troubleshooting
- eSIM installation guidance
- Port-in or port-out explanations
- Billing cycle or plan-related questions
- General account or service FAQs
## **When NOT to Use Macros Alone**Macros should not be sent blindly when:

- The customer issue is unique or complex
- Account-specific investigation is required
- The situation involves escalation or sensitive handling
In such cases, macros may be used as a base, but the response must be customized.

## **How to Use Macros in Zendesk**
- Open the customer ticket or chat
- Enter a forward slash “/” on the chat box, or
- Click the **Macros** option or use the macro search
- Select the relevant macro based on the customer issue
- Insert the macro into the reply
## **How to Use Shortcuts in Zendesk**
- Place your cursor in the reply field
- Type forward slash “/” followed by the shortcut keyword or trigger
- Select the appropriate canned response
- Insert it into the conversation
## **Mandatory Verification Before Sending**Macros and shortcuts are **starting points**, not final answers. Agents must always verify the content.

Before sending, ensure:

- The response matches the customer’s exact issue
- Any placeholders or variables are correctly filled
- Instructions align with the customer’s device or situation
- The tone remains warm, friendly, and on-brand
**Never send a macro without reviewing it first.**

## **Editing Macros for Accuracy**Agents are expected to:

- Remove any irrelevant steps
- Add missing context if required
- Adjust wording slightly to fit the conversation flow
- Ensure no incorrect assumptions are made
Macros should improve speed, not replace understanding.

## **Quality & Compliance Guidelines**
- Always read the full macro before sending
- Do not modify the core meaning unless required
- Do not add unapproved promises or timelines
- Ensure first-contact resolution whenever possible
## **Best Practices**
- Use macros to save time, not skip thinking
- Combine empathy with accuracy
- Keep responses clear and easy to understand
- If unsure, escalate rather than guessing
## **Summary**Macros and shortcuts are tools to help you respond faster and more accurately. When used correctly with verification and light customization they improve efficiency, consistency, and customer satisfaction while maintaining the Meow Mobile brand experience.

#### Mandatory Checks & Required Fields (Zendesk)
*Article ID: 44455843878043 | Updated: 2025-12-16*
*URL: https://rockstarautomations.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/44455843878043-Mandatory-Checks-Required-Fields-Zendesk*

# **Mandatory checks & required fields to be filled before changing the status of a ticket (Zendesk) (General)****Key Responsibility**: Perform all checks, complete all fields before changing the status of the ticket, and escalate correctly if required.

 

**Step-1**:** As soon as a ticket lands in the queue, after accepting the ticket.**

- Check if the customer's email address has been automatically updated in the Requester tab **(located on the far-left section** of the Zendesk interface).
- Ensure the customer's email ID is entered; updates regarding their ticket will not be sent otherwise. If the email is missing, it must be entered manually.

 

 

**Step-2**: **Ensure accurate ticket tagging based on customer’s concern.**

- 
**Type of Concern:** Question, Incident, Problem, and Task. Make sure you record the exact type of concern the customer contacted **support about**.

 

- 
**Inquiry Type: **Next, state the precise reason the customer contacted us. To easily select the correct inquiry reason, simply type relevant keywords into the dropdown box. For instance, if a customer is asking about plan details, type "Meow Offerings" and then select the corresponding inquiry type.
 

 

- 
**Ticket Process: **Specify the channel the customer used to contact us. Examples include Chat, Email, or, in rare cases, a Slack Escalation.
 

 

**Step-3:**** **

**Mandatory Field: Customer Mobile Number**

Filling in the Customer Mobile Number is mandatory. **This** allows us to easily contact the customer for follow-up communication after the ticket has been solved, provided this is their preferred method.

 

**Step-4****: Ticket Priority: **The Ticket Priority field is used to define the urgency and business impact of a customer issue. It helps the system and support teams identify which tickets require immediate attention and ensures that customer concerns are handled within the defined Service Level Agreements (SLAs).

 

 

**Step-5: ****End Session**

It is mandatory to end a messaging session after the customer has concluded the live chat. Failing to do so will result in future conversations **with** that customer continuing on the same ticket, making tracking difficult for management.

It ensures the interaction is **formally closed, accurately recorded, and correctly handed off** within the system. It also confirms that the agent has **completed all required actions** for the customer and prevents open or idle sessions from impacting service quality and reporting.

- It prevents duplicate or overlapping sessions.
- Allows accurate tracking of handle time and productivity
- Supports correct SLA calculation and reporting
- Confirms that the customer has received a final response or next steps.
Failure to end a session properly may lead to data mismatch, reporting errors, missed follow-ups, and customer dissatisfaction. Therefore, you must always confirm the interaction is complete and formally end the session as per process before moving to the next ticket.

**Mandatory Checks and Required Fields for L1 Ticket Escalation (Zendesk)**

**Key Responsibility: **To ensure that all tickets escalated to L1 Support from Zendesk contain complete, accurate, and verified information, enabling faster resolution and reducing back-and-forth communication between teams.

**Escalation Trigger: Escalate the ticket only after providing the troubleshooting steps mentioned in the Knowledge Bank and the issue remains unresolved.**

- 
**Step-1:** The mandatory fields that must be completed are: Requester, Type, Inquiry Type, Ticket Process, Customer’s Mobile Number, and Ticket Priority.
- 
**Step-2: **To ensure the L1 team can efficiently investigate and resolve customer issues behind the scenes, you must fill all the below fields accurately and completely at the time of escalation. Incomplete or unclear information may delay resolution and lead to rework.
**Email Address:**
- **Mobile Number:**
- **Issue:**
- **Troubleshooting Steps followed:**
- **Escalated By:**
- **Customer Expectation (If any):**

When including the email address in the template, double-check to ensure there are no spelling errors or incorrect domains. Additionally, remember these points when **detailing the issue**:

- What is not working
- Since when the issue started
- Frequency (intermittent/continuous)
- Any exact error messages
**When outlining customer expectations, consider the following points:**

- Mention any **specific request, deadline, or preference** expressed by the customer
- Example:
Callback request
- Urgent resolution timeline
- Refund request

- If no expectation is stated, clearly mention **“No specific expectation shared”**

- 
**Step-3: **Assign the ticket to the L1-Group rather than to a specific individual within that team.
- 
**Step-4: **End Session before changing the ticket status.

- 
**Step-5: **Change the status of the ticket from “**Open**” to “**On-Hold**”.

#### How to Check if eSIM is Already Activated?
*Article ID: 44462986203419 | Updated: 2025-12-17*
*URL: https://rockstarautomations.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/44462986203419-How-to-Check-if-eSIM-is-Already-Activated*

Updated:

### Situation:Customers usually ask this question after signing up for Meow Wireless and receiving their eSIM activation email.
They may be:

- Unsure how to install or scan the QR code.

- Trying to activate on a device that’s not eSIM-compatible.

- Reporting that they didn’t receive their activation link or email.

Agents should be familiar with the basic steps of eSIM setup and the resources available in ConnectX for troubleshooting activation issues.

### Task:The agent’s goal is to guide the customer through eSIM activation, confirm whether their device supports eSIM, and ensure the activation completes successfully. If activation fails or the email hasn’t arrived, the agent should verify the account status in ConnectX.

### Steps for Agents:#### 1. Verify customer details in the ConnectX panel in Zendesk first. If information is not available, proceed to ConnectX Admin:
- Go to ConnectX > Customer360.

- Search by email or phone number.

- Check the Account Status and ensure that the eSIM has been issued **(status: “Activation Pending” or “Activated”)**.

- Confirm that the activation link or QR code was sent to the registered email.

#### 2. Ask clarifying questions:
- “Have you received your eSIM activation email from Meow Wireless?”

- “Are you using an eSIM-compatible device?”

- “Did you already scan the QR code or try the activation link?”

- “Are you seeing any specific error message during setup?”

These questions help identify if the issue is with email delivery, device compatibility, or activation failure.

### Action:If the customer received the activation email but hasn’t installed the eSIM yet:

Guide them through the standard activation steps.

Example Response:
“Thanks for confirming! You can activate your Meow Wireless eSIM by following these steps:

- Open the email from Meow Wireless containing your eSIM QR code.

- On your phone, go to Settings > Cellular/Mobile Network > Add eSIM.

- Scan the QR code or enter the activation details manually.

- Wait for your device to complete setup — this usually takes just a few minutes.
Once installed, your Meow Wireless service will automatically activate and you’ll see our network appear on your phone.”

Next Steps for Agent:

- Confirm activation completion in ConnectX (status: “Active”).

- Tag the ticket accordingly.

If the customer hasn’t received their eSIM activation email:

Check whether it was sent or delayed.

Example Response:
“I see that your eSIM activation email hasn’t arrived yet — no worries! Sometimes it takes up to 30 minutes to appear in your inbox or spam folder. If you still don’t see it, I’ll request a resend for you.”

Next Steps for Agent:

- Confirm email address on file.

- **Request resend via ConnectX → ****Actions > Resend Activation Email****.**

- Advise the customer to check all folders (Inbox, Spam, Promotions).

- Tag ticket accordingly.

If the customer reports that activation failed:

Verify device compatibility and escalate if needed.

Example Response:
“Thanks for letting us know. If your device showed an error during eSIM setup, it could be due to compatibility or connection issues. Let’s try reinstalling:

- Remove the previous eSIM attempt from your phone’s settings.

- Restart your device.

- Re-scan the QR code or click the activation link again.
If it still doesn’t activate, we’ll escalate this to our Technical Team for manual provisioning.”

Next Steps for Agent:

- **Check device compatibility in ConnectX (supported device list).**

- **If reinstallation fails, escalate to **L1 → eSIM Activation Issue**.**

- **Advise the customer of a **24–48 hour turnaround time** for resolution.**

- Tag ticket accordingly.

### Result:
- The customer successfully activates their Meow Wireless eSIM or receives clear next steps.

- Delayed or failed activations are escalated properly through ConnectX.

- The customer gains immediate access to network service and Meow Wireless benefits.

### Additional Notes:
- Never resend QR codes manually outside ConnectX.

- Always verify device compatibility before troubleshooting further.

- Escalate only if activation remains unposted after 48 hours or repeated failure occurs.

- Confirm email and device information carefully before proceeding.

#### Voicemail Box Full
*Article ID: 46569014727323 | Updated: 2026-02-12*
*URL: https://rockstarautomations.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/46569014727323-Voicemail-Box-Full*

### **What this means:**When the voicemail box is full, **new callers cannot leave messages** until existing voicemails are deleted. This is a **storage issue on the voicemail platform**, not a network issue.

## **✅ L0 Confirmation Checklist**
- Old voicemails deleted
- Deleted messages folder cleared (iPhone)
- Test voicemail successful
- Customer confirms resolution
## **📱 iPhone – Clear Voicemail Box**### **Step 1: Delete Voicemails from Visual Voicemail**
- Open the **Phone** app
- Tap **Voicemail** (bottom-right)
- Review the list of voicemails
- Swipe **left** on old or unwanted voicemails
- Tap **Delete**

### **Step 2: Empty Deleted Messages (Important)**Deleted voicemails may still take up space.

- In **Voicemail**, scroll down
- Tap **Deleted Messages**

- Tap **Clear All**

- Confirm deletion
### **Step 3: Test Voicemail**
- Call the customer’s number from another phone
- Let it ring to voicemail
- Confirm a new voicemail can be left
If successful → close case.

## **🤖 Android – Clear Voicemail Box**Steps may vary slightly by manufacturer (Samsung, Pixel, etc.)

### **Option A: Visual Voicemail App**
- Open the **Phone** app
- Tap **Voicemail** or **Visual Voicemail**

- Long-press old voicemails

- If mailbox still shows full after deletion → escalate (possible backend sync issue)
 

- 
**How to Set / change / retrieve Voicemail PIN ? (Universal Method)**
Open the **Phone** app
- **Press and hold 1** *(or dial *86)*
- When prompted, enter the **current PIN**

#### Lost/Stolen Device
*Article ID: 44455497814555 | Updated: 2025-12-19*
*URL: https://rockstarautomations.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/44455497814555-Lost-Stolen-Device*

**SOP: Lost/Stolen Device**

**Scenario**:

Customers report that their device is lost or stolen and needs the line to be suspended to prevent unauthorized use.

**Step 1:** **Probing, Empathizing with the customer**

- Acknowledge the concern and assure assistance
- 
Inform the customer about the consequences of suspension: 
Suspending the plan will immediately block calls, SMS, and data usage. 
- This helps prevent any unauthorized usage or charges.

- Verify the email ID by sending an OTP
- We will ask if they have an alternative device to re-activate the eSIM. If not, we will suggest suspending the line until they get a new device, as this is a high-risk transaction.
**Step 2: Tools to analyze and handle - ConnectX**

- Launch the ConnectX application or webpage.
- 
Search for the customer account using their Email ID, Phone Number, or Name.

- 
Click on the **Products tab** once the account is open.

- 
Select the Plan tab under the Products menu.

- 
Navigate to the Product Details section and click on the 3 dots (⋮) menu icon.

- ###  Click on **Suspension**.
- 
### Click on confirm for sure you want to suspend?
### 

- 
Select the Reason for Suspension.

-  Add notes after selecting the reason for suspension.

- ### Select the Suspension Date as End of the Cycle (Note: For Lost Device or Scam, select immediate/today's date).## **Step 3 – Communication & Customer Guidance**Inform the customer:

- The plan has been **successfully suspended**.
- No further usage will occur while suspended.
- Billing behavior during suspension (as per policy, if applicable).
- 
Advise the customer to:
Report the theft to local authorities if the device is stolen.
- Secure personal accounts (email, banking, social apps) linked to the device.

- 
Explain next steps:
Plan can be **reactivated** once the customer has a new device.
- A **new eSIM** can be issued if required.
- MSISDN can usually be retained unless otherwise restricted.

#### Carrier-Restricted Device
*Article ID: 44455469897243 | Updated: 2025-12-19*
*URL: https://rockstarautomations.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/44455469897243-Carrier-Restricted-Device*

## **SOP: Device Compatibility and Status / Carrier-Restricted Device****Scenario:** Customer cannot activate service because their device is either **not compatible with the network technology (e.g., specific bands)** or is **locked/restricted by a previous carrier**.

### **Step 1 - Probing, Empathizing with the Customer**
- 
**Acknowledge the concern and assure assistance.** (e.g., "I understand this is frustrating. Since your account looks active on our side, let's check your device setup, as that is the most common reason for these messages. I'll guide you through it.")
- 
**Confirm Key Details:**

**Device Model and exact OS Version.** (Crucial for compatibility check).
- 
**Where the device was purchased** (e.g., specific carrier, retailer, unlocked).
- 
**Previous Carrier** (if applicable).
- 
**If the device has ever been used successfully** with another carrier's SIM/eSIM since purchasing it.
- The **exact error message** displayed on the screen (e.g., "SIM Not Supported," "Invalid SIM," "Enter Unlock Code").
- 
**If the customer has confirmed the device is unlocked** with the previous carrier.

- 
**Take an alternate contact number **from the customer.
### **Step 2 - Tools to Analyze and Handle**

**Sl. No.**
**What to check**
**Where to check**

1
Check if the IMEI is blacklisted or flagged for any reason. (Internal Notes on ConnecX)
[View/Add Account Notes](https://rockstarautomations.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/44601230033691-View-Add-Account-Notes-ConnectX)

2
Check for Similar Issues - Zendesk

[Similar Ongoing/Past Tickets](https://rockstarautomations.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/44600232393243)

### **Step 3 - Troubleshooting Steps to be done (Standard L0) - Refer to **[**Troubleshooting Guide**](https://rockstarautomations.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/44455761075099)The focus is on isolating the issue to network compatibility or carrier lock.

- **Check complete ticket history and past conversations on Zendesk.**
- 
**Review all previous troubleshooting** already performed.
- **Check internal notes on the account in ConnectX.**
- 
**Confirm system status:** Verify that the service provisioning is **Active** and the eSIM is registered in the system (i.e., the problem is device-specific, not a provisioning failure).*If the eSIM is not registered, the provisioning SOP should be followed first.*

- 
**Verify Device Lock Status (Primary Fix):**

**If the error message is "eSIM Not Supported" or "Carrier Lock":** This is the strongest indicator of a carrier restriction.

**Instruct the customer** that the device appears to be locked to their previous carrier.
- 
**Provide guidance** on the process to contact their previous carrier to request an unlock.

- 
**If the customer *****claims***** it is unlocked:**Ask the customer to **insert a known-working SIM card from a different carrier** (if available) to independently test the unlock status.

- 
**Verify APN Settings (Standard Check):**
If the error is **"No Signal"** and *not* a lock error, guide the customer to check and update the **APN (Access Point Name)** settings to the correct carrier standard.
- Instruct them to manually enter the correct APN - “**ereseller**”.

- 
**Basic Device Checks:**
**Power Cycle:** Instruct the customer to turn the device off, remove/re-insert the physical SIM (if applicable), wait 30 seconds, and turn it back on.

- 
**Device Compatibility Confirmation:**Based on the check in Step 3, clearly inform the customer of the compatibility status:
"Your **[Device Model]** is compatible with our network." (Proceed to Step 5 if lock is still suspected).
- "We have confirmed that your **[Device Model]** **does not support the required [Technology/Band]** needed for service in your area." (Proceed to Step 5).

### **Step 4 - Providing the TAT to Customer & Next Steps**
- 
**If the Device is Identified as Carrier-Locked:**
Inform the customer that **the issue is resolved by the previous carrier**, not our internal team.
- Provide the **exact contact information/process** for the previous carrier's unlocking team.
- 
**Action for the customer:** Obtain the unlock code/confirmation.
- 
**Next step for you:** Mark the ticket as "Resolved - Device Lock," or "Pending Customer Action."

- 
**If the Device is Identified as Incompatible:**
Inform the customer clearly that their device cannot be used on the network.
- 
**Action for the customer:** Obtain a compatible device.
- 
**Offer assistance:** Provide details on purchasing compatible devices (e.g., link to company store).

- 
**If the Device is Compatible, but Lock/Issue Persists (Uncommon):**
Inform the customer that backend verification of the device registration may be required.
- Provide a standard TAT of: **2 - 4 hours** (or as per policy) for L1 to verify the IMEI provisioning status against the network register.
- Assure proactive update once the L1 investigation is completed.

### **Step 5 - Escalating to L1 - Steps to be Completed on Zendesk (If Issue is NOT a Clear Lock/Incompatibility)**
- **Ensure all mandatory fields are filled.**
- **Set correct Ticket Priority**
- 
**Add complete internal escalation notes,** detailing:

- The **Exact Error Message** seen on the device.
- Results of **APN Check** and **Network Reset**.
- If a **test SIM** from another carrier was used and the result.

- 
**Attach all screenshots** (e.g., system showing active provisioning, or the device error message provided by the customer).
- **Change ticket status to On-Hold if escalated to L1.**
- 
**Details to be provided to L1 (Confirmed Mandatory):**
**Device Model + OS Version.**
- **IMEI Number.**

#### Locked Device
*Article ID: 44455447219099 | Updated: 2025-12-19*
*URL: https://rockstarautomations.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/44455447219099-Locked-Device*

**SOP for Locked Device **

 

**Step 1 - Visual Audit (Review & Pre-Requisites)**

**Check complete ticket history and past conversations. (**[**Zendesk**](https://rockstarautomations.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/44600232393243)**)**

- Verify Customer Eligibility:
Confirm the customer's Device Model is officially supported for eSIM.( Check in Compatible List device list)
- 
Ensure the customer's Account Status is Active and in good standing.

 

- Crucial Device Lock Confirmation:
If the customer is porting or migrating, ask directly: "Is your device currently locked to your previous carrier, or has the device unlock process been completed?"

 

## **Step 2 - Probing & Managing Expectations (Pre-Provisioning)****Acknowledge the request but immediately pivot to addressing the device lock. Do NOT proceed to the next step until the lock is resolved.**

- Educate the Customer:
Explain clearly that the device must be fully unlocked by the previous carrier before our eSIM can be successfully downloaded and installed.
- Use empathic language: "I understand you are eager to switch, but to ensure your new service works without issues, we must first confirm your phone is fully unlocked."

- Provide Clear Next Steps for the Customer:
Instruct the customer on how to check their device's lock status (e.g., using a SIM card from a different carrier).
- Advise them to contact their previous carrier (Name them, if possible) to request or confirm the unlock has been processed through their helpline, chat or email support.
- Crucial Action: Inform the customer to contact us again only after they receive confirmation from their previous carrier that the device is unlocked.
 

## **Step 3 - Initiating the eSIM Request :**

**Condition**
**L0 Action in ConnectX/App**
**Next Expected Outcome**

**If Device Status is PENDING UNLOCK**
DO NOT Initiate Provisioning. (No action in ConnectX needed).
The customer contacts the previous carrier and returns to us when the unlock is confirmed.

**If Device Status is CONFIRMED UNLOCKED**
Proceed with standard provisioning 
System processes request; QR/link sent to the customer's registered email/phone.

 

## **Step 4 - Troubleshooting Specific to Locked Devices**- If the customer reports an installation error code, specifically look for messages related to "SIM Not Supported," "Carrier Lock," or "Cannot Add Data Plan (Carrier Restriction)."
Action: If these errors appear, reiterate Step 2. Provisioning will always fail until the external carrier unlocks the device.
- ConnectX Check: If an eSIM request was mistakenly initiated (Step 3B), check Interactions >> Communication log.  - Refer to How to [Check interactions on ConnectX](https://rockstarautomations.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/44600611412123-Check-Interactions-ConnectX).

**Step 5 - Documentation and Resolution**

- Ticket Documentation:Document the date and time the customer was informed that the device must be unlocked.

- Resolution:Do not escalate to L1. The issue is external (the locking carrier), not internal.

## **Step 6 - Escalation Check****Escalate ONLY if: **The customer confirms the previous carrier completed the unlock, and a new provisioning attempt fails with an internal system error NOT related to carrier restrictions.

**Details to be provided upon Re-Engaging and Successful Provisioning Failure:**

- Customer Account Number/ID.
- Clear Confirmation: "The customer has confirmed with [Previous Carrier Name] that the device is unlocked."
- Time & Date of the failed eSIM Request Attempt *after* unlock confirmation.
- ConnectX Provisioning Status (showing "Failed to Provision").
- Error Codes or System Messages (If any).
