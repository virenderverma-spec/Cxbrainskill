### Reading Email Threads

When handling an email with history:

1. **Read bottom-up** - Start from the oldest message
2. **Note what's been tried** - Don't repeat previous agent's steps
3. **Check for promises** - Honor commitments made
4. **Identify sentiment trend** - Getting better or worse?

### Continuing a Thread

```
Hi [Name],

Following up on your case about [issue]...

[If resolved:]
I'm happy to report that [resolution].

[If in progress:]
I wanted to update you that [status]. We expect [next step] by [timeline].

[If need info:]
I'm still looking into this, but I need [info] to proceed.
```

### Closing a Thread

```

Just checking in - were you able to [action from previous email]?

If everything's working now, great! If you're still having trouble, let me know and I'll keep digging.

Best,
[Agent Name]
```

## Email Tone Guidelines

### DO:

- **Be warm but professional**: "Thanks for reaching out!" not "Hey!"
- **Be thorough**: Email readers can't ask immediate follow-ups
- **Use their name**: Personalization matters
- **Acknowledge wait time**: "Thanks for your patience" if delayed
- **Format for readability**: Use bullets, numbers, bold headers
- **Proofread**: Email typos look unprofessional
- **Sign off warmly**: "Best," "Thanks," "Take care"

### DON'T:

- **Use chat-speak**: No "u" for "you", no "thx" for "thanks"
- **Be too casual**: No "lol", "haha", or excessive emojis
- **Leave questions unanswered**: Address everything they asked
- **Make them dig for info**: Put key info at the top
- **Blame other teams**: "Our system" not "the engineering team"
- **Be robotic**: Show personality within professional bounds

### Tone Examples

**Too casual:**
> hey! so ur esim isnt working huh? no worries lets fix it lol

**Too formal:**
> Dear Valued Customer, We are in receipt of your inquiry regarding your electronic SIM card. Please be advised that...

**Just right:**
> Hi Sarah! I'm sorry to hear your eSIM isn't cooperating. Let me help you get this sorted out.

## Email-Specific Scenarios

### Scenario: Customer Forwarded a Receipt/Confirmation

Customer forwarded an automated email asking about it:

```
Hi [Name],

I see you received [type of email - receipt, confirmation, etc.]. Let me explain what this means:

[Explanation of what the email indicates]

[Any action they need to take, or confirmation that no action needed]

Does this help clarify things?
```

### Scenario: Customer CC'd Someone

When customer CC's a spouse, family member, or other party:

- Include all parties in reply (Reply All)
- Address primary contact by name
- Keep response appropriate for multiple readers

### Scenario: Customer is Angry (Email)

Angry emails require extra care:

```
Hi [Name],

I completely understand your frustration, and I'm truly sorry for this experience. This isn't how things should work, and I want to make it right.

[Address their specific complaint with empathy]

Here's what I'm doing to fix this:
[Concrete actions]

I'll personally follow up to make sure this gets resolved. You can reply directly to me at any time.

Sincerely,
[Agent Name]
```

### Scenario: No Response to Previous Email

Following up when customer hasn't replied:

```
Subject: Re: [Original Subject] - Following up

Hi [Name],

I wanted to check in on my previous email about [issue].

[If you asked for info:]
Were you able to find [info needed]? Once I have that, I can [next step].

[If you provided a solution:]
Did the steps I sent work for you? Let me know if you're still having trouble.

[If you processed something:]
Just confirming - did you receive [refund/credit/etc.]?

No rush, but I want to make sure you're taken care of!

Best,
[Agent Name]
